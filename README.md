NYC Rat project

A place for all of our (quinn, christian, kara, chris) NYC rat findings

Summary of Findings

Seasonal Sightings

Rat sightings in New York City do vary by season with the highest number of sightings occurring in Summer months and lowest number occurring in winter months. Our research shows ta correlation between rising temperatures and an increase in sightings.  The higher sightings in summer can be attributed to the rat life cycle with new babies being born in summer months and rats nesting and preparing for the winter months.

Sightings by Borough

Rat sightings do vary by borough with the highest number of sightings are in Brooklyn and lowest number of sightings occurring on Staten Island.  Our initial assumptions were that Manhattan would have the most sightings since it is considered the busiest borough with the busiest subway stations (e.g. Times Square, Grand Central, Herald Square). But our data shows that most sightings occur in residential areas and Brooklyn is the most populated borough and Staten Island is the least populated.  Increased sightings in residential areas can be attributed to amount of trash that can be found in small areas and the prevalence of green space for rats to nest and hide in.

Subway Station Sightings

There is a correlation between rat sightings and the subway lines.  This can be attributed to more trash in the more populated areas of subway stations and the proclivity of rats to live underground and in dark spaces like subway tunnels.  

Conclusion

Our findings show that if you do not want to see rats in New York City, then you should not live in Brooklyn, visit during the summer months and avoid the subway.  The data compiled is consistent year over year to support our findings and the only real limitation we could pinpoint was in the sources that will report sightings. We assume that residents are more likely to report sightings than tourists as residents are more likely to know the procedure for reporting.  We also assume homeowners are less likely to report than renters as renters as renters would want their landlords to fix the problem whereas homeowners would have the responsibility to fix it themselves.
